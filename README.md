# todos
A todo app. The goal of this project is to have most of ASANA's features (step by step tho)
one day.

features it has right now:
  1. creating projects (with add/edit/delete)
  2. each project can have many todo categores (with add/edit/delete)
  3. each category can have many todo item (with add/edit/delete)
  4. each category can be shared among diffrent projects (with detach/attach)
  5. each project can be shared with other users (with detach/attach)
  6. each todo can have many comments (with add/edit/delete)
  7. you can sort todo categories or todo items in any arbitrary order and it will be saved on your user account (I'm storing this using linked list)
  8. each todo can have multiple tags (with add/edit/delete)
  9. you can search (all projects/project specific) by tag
