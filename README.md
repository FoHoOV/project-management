# todos
A todo app much like asana but its free and open-source

# how to run
  1. goto backend and install `requirements.txt` dependencies and run app
  2. goto frontend and run `npm i` then `npm run build` and `npm run preview`

* frontend was built from [this](https://github.com/FoHoOV/svelte-template) template
